Phase 1: Detection Framework

Calculate 5MR with clear high/low values
Track breakouts with minimum 0.3% move beyond range
Create visual indicators for range and breakout confirmation

Phase 2: Retest Logic

Track maximum price move after breakout (for qualification)
Implement retest detection (price returning to within 0.1% of breakout level)
Add retest qualification based on rejection patterns

Phase 3: Entry System

Implement entry logic on qualified retests
Add confirmation requirements (close in breakout direction after retest)
Integrate with existing risk management system

Phase 4: Performance Tracking

Track retest strategy performance separately
Compare with first entry results
Identify market conditions favoring each approach



=====================================================================================================================

Here's a summary of what Phase 1 implements:

Global Configuration

Strategy inputs for risk management, position sizing, visualization
Retest-specific parameters for breakout and retest detection


Time Management

Session definitions for 5-minute Morning Range period
Trading hours and day boundary detection


Market Context

Daily trend determination using 50 EMA


Morning Range Calculation

Identifies the 5-minute morning range (9:15-9:20)
Calculates range size and validates quality using ATR/MR ratio


Breakout Detection

Tracks breakouts above MR high and below MR low
Requires minimum percentage move (0.3% by default)
Records maximum price excursion after breakouts


Visualization

Plots MR high and low lines
Marks breakout points with triangles
Optional debug logging


=====================================================================================================================

Here's a summary of what Phase 2 implements:

Retest Tracking Variables

Added variables to track detected retests in both directions
Separate flags for detected vs. qualified retests
Price and bar index tracking for retest points


Pullback Detection Logic

Detects when price pulls back to the MR high/low after a breakout
Uses percentage-based tolerance (configurable via maxRetestDistance)
Records the retest price and bar for entry logic


Retest Qualification

Ensures the retest is a true pullback, not a failed breakout
For longs: Validates that price is retesting MR high from above
For shorts: Validates that price is retesting MR low from below
Requires a minimum initial breakout move before qualifying retests


Visualization Enhancements

Added dashed lines to show retest levels
Added diamond markers to highlight retest points
Different visual indicators for qualified vs. non-qualified retests
Debug logging with retest details



This phase focuses purely on identifying valid retest opportunities. It correctly detects when price returns to test the breakout level after an initial move away, and validates whether this is a genuine retest (from the correct direction) rather than a failed breakout.


=====================================================================================================================


Here's a summary of what Phase 3 implements:

Trade State Management

Added variables to track trade status (active trades, stops, targets)
Position sizing and quantity calculation
Reset logic for all variables on new trading day


Entry Logic

Implemented precise entry conditions for both long and short trades
For long entries: triggers when price shows rejection at MR high level (closes above)
For short entries: triggers when price shows rejection at MR low level (closes below)
Added trend alignment filter based on the respectTrend setting


Risk Management

Calculates stop loss based on percentage risk (0.75% default)
Sets up three take profit levels at 1:3, 1:5, and 1:7 risk-reward ratios
Implements position sizing based on money risk (initRisk parameter)
Divides position into three parts for scaling out (10%, 40%, 50%)


Order Execution

Generates entry signals using strategy.entry()
Ensures only one trade per day
Prevents conflicting entries (no long and short at the same time)


Visualization Enhancements

Added entry markers with trade details
Displays stop loss and take profit levels as lines
Maintains visual trade tracking throughout the trade lifecycle
