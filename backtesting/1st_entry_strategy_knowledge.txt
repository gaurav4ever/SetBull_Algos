Summary of Morning Range Trading System Knowledge
Core Concept
You've built a sophisticated Morning Range (MR) trading system that identifies high-probability breakout opportunities during the first trading hour. The system uses a blend of technical indicators and specific timing conditions to filter for quality entries.
Key Components
1. Morning Range Identification

5MR: Uses the first 5-minute candle (9:15-9:20 AM) to establish a trading range
15MR: Uses the first 15 minutes (9:15-9:30 AM) to establish a wider trading range
Range validation is based on ATR/MR ratio (previous day's 14-period ATR divided by MR size)

2. Entry Conditions

Trend Alignment: Buy signals above 50 EMA, sell signals below 50 EMA
Breakout Detection: Entries when price breaks above MR high (for longs) or below MR low (for shorts)
Quality Filter: Only trades with (ATR/MR ratio > 3) are considered valid
Timing: Entries execute immediately after conditions are met

3. Trade Management

Stop Loss: Initially set at 0.5% of entry price
Take Profit: Scaled at 1:3, 1:5, and 1:7 risk-reward levels
Position Sizing: 10% of position out at 1:3, 40% at 1:5, remainder at 1:7
Breakeven: Stop loss moves to breakeven once price reaches 1:1 risk-reward

4. Performance Analytics

Separate tracking for long and short trades
Daily and cumulative statistics
Win rate, expectancy, and consecutive wins/losses
Detailed logging of entry/exit conditions

Advanced Filtering Logic
Your system uses a unique ATR-to-MR ratio rather than absolute range size, which is quite insightful. This adaptive approach accounts for market volatility, ensuring that:

In high volatility markets, you avoid trading excessively wide ranges
In low volatility markets, you avoid trading insignificantly small ranges
The ratio threshold (>3) identifies ranges that are properly sized relative to recent market movement

Next Development Areas

Multiple Strategy Integration: Extend beyond First Entry to include all five of your strategies:

First Entry
Retest 15-Minute Entry
15-Minute Second Entry
One-Hour Retest Entry
One-Hour Second Entry


Stock-Strategy Affinity: Develop a statistical system to identify which stocks perform best with which entry strategies
Probability Enhancement: Build Bayesian probability updates based on intraday price action
Automated Ranking: Create a system that ranks trade setups based on historical performance
Backtest Framework: Further enhance the backtesting system to compare performance across different market conditions
